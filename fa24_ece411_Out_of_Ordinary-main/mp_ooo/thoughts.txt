To whoever is reading this:
I kinda wrote this in a questionable mental state as I usually go to bed before 11pm lol. I just want
to make one final push to make the total commit number 411 at the beginning. However, another thought
sparked in my head: Why not making this a closing remark and a quick reflection of how this project
went? I really question if anyone would read this, so I'll make this casual and act more like a note-
-to-self lol.

One of the major thing I would like to reflect on is the time management/project planning aspect. We 
came to this project with great dream and hope but weren't able to complete them for various reasons.
Of course, life will never be perfect, and I want to take some time to reflect what went well/not well
to avoid situations like this in the future. The last week had been a tough and arguably unproductive
grind. Here are the few major aspects we could work on: (actually I am really sleepy rn so I'll keep
this high level):
1. planning:
    1.1 analyze the problem a bit more before we start
    1.2 think about what optimization combo will serve us the best
2. execution:
    2.1 more hours working together and more communication about what each other is doing
    2.2 better (currently almost non_existent) documentation to make sure we all understand what's 
        going on
    2.3 more "deep work", explaining this later (maybe later to myself)
3. conclusion:
    3.1 we haven't done this part yet (gonna do that in the final report), so we'll come back to
        this (hopefully)?

It been a good ride. Big thanks to our mentor Udit for helping us along the way. Really respect the
fact that he almost always respond instantly lol. I will probably try to continue this project because
there are so many things to learn.
